# Software Brauerei Coding Challenge

The code of the challenges can be executed using Python 3.11.

## Run code
If you have poetry installed run `poetry install` and then `poetry run python <name_of_challenge>.py <input_file_1>.json ...` to run the code on a given input
Otherwise make sure you have python3.11 installed and run `python3.11 <name_of_challenge>.py <input_file_1>.json ...`

## Run tests
Run the `tests.py` file. Usually I would use pytest, but for the scope of a coding challenge I think this works too.
